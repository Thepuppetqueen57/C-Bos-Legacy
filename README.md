C-Bos is getting rewritten in C++ so this will not be updated! Check out the rewrite [here](https://github.com/Thepuppetqueen57/C-Bos)

Latest version no longer works! I'm pretty sure the latest version that works is 3.2 it is the commit right before the one named "4.0!" so yeah. Xytriza will not be helping with the rewrite btw.
